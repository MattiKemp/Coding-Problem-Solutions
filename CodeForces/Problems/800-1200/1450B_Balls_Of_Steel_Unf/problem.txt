B. Balls of Steel
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1450/B
You have n distinct points (x1,y1),…,(xn,yn) on the plane and a non-negative integer parameter k. Each point is a microscopic steel ball and k is the attract power of a ball when it's charged. The attract power is the same for all balls.

In one operation, you can select a ball i to charge it. Once charged, all balls with Manhattan distance at most k from ball i move to the position of ball i. Many balls may have the same coordinate after an operation.

More formally, for all balls j such that |xi−xj|+|yi−yj|≤k, we assign xj:=xi and yj:=yi.

An example of an operation. After charging the ball in the center, two other balls move to its position. On the right side, the red dot in the center is the common position of those balls.
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the same position, or report that this is impossible.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k (2≤n≤100, 0≤k≤106) — the number of balls and the attract power of all balls, respectively.

The following n lines describe the balls' coordinates. The i-th of these lines contains two integers xi, yi (0≤xi,yi≤105) — the coordinates of the i-th ball.

It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.

Output
For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the same position, or −1 if it is impossible.
