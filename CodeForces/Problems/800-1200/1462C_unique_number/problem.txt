C. Unique Number
Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1462/C
You are given a positive number x. Find the smallest positive integer number that has the sum of digits equal to x and
all digits are distinct (unique).

Input
The first line contains a single positive integer t (1≤t≤50) — the number of test cases in the test. Then t test cases
follow.

Each test case consists of a single integer number x (1≤x≤50).

Output
Output t answers to the test cases:

if a positive integer number with the sum of digits equal to x and all digits are different exists, print the smallest
such number;
otherwise print -1.
