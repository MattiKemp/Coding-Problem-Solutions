You are given an integer n. In 1 move, you can do one of the following actions:

erase any digit of the number (it's acceptable that the number before the operation has exactly one digit and after the operation, it is "empty");
add one digit to the right.
The actions may be performed in any order any number of times.

Note that if, after deleting some digit from a number, it will contain leading zeroes, they will not be deleted. E.g. if you delete from the number 301 the digit 3, the result is the number 01 (not 1).

You need to perform the minimum number of actions to make the number any power of 2 (i.e. there's an integer k (kâ‰¥0) such that the resulting number is equal to 2k). The resulting number must not have leading zeroes.

E.g. consider n=1052. The answer is equal to 2. First, let's add to the right one digit 4 (the result will be 10524). Then let's erase the digit 5, so the result will be 1024 which is a power of 2.

E.g. consider n=8888. The answer is equal to 3. Let's erase any of the digits 8 three times. The result will be 8 which is a power of 2.
