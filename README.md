# LeetCFAndHackerRank
Saved solutions for leet code, code forces, and hackerrank for studying.
Cracking the coding interview data structure and specific algorithim implementations can be found in my Data-Structures-And-Algorithms repo.
Mainly doing this because there has been several occasions where I wanted to go back to a problem I was working on but the website didn't save my solution or code properly.
This is really important if I try implementing the problems in different ways: naive, optimized, best, recursive, or iterative soltuions. 
Also this gives me good practice documenting my code and explaining my solutions like in technical interviews.
