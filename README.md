# LeetAndCF
Saved solutions for leet code, code forces, and ctci problems for review and studying.
Cracking the coding interview data structure and specific algorithim implementations can be found in my Data-Structures-And-Algorithms repo.
Mainly doing this because there has been several occasions where I wanted to go back to a problem I was working on but the website didn't save my solution or code properly.
This is really important if I try implementing the problems in different ways: naive, optimized, best, recursive, or iterative soltuions. 
Also this gives me good practice documenting my code and explaining my solutions like in technical interviews.
